# Smart Caller and Scheduler

Smart Caller and Scheduler is a **Java-based mini project** developed to demonstrate practical knowledge of **Java Data Structures** by implementing an intelligent call scheduling and prioritization system.

The application helps users schedule calls, prioritize them based on urgency, notify recipients through email, and alert users using a graphical interface.  
It is designed for everyday professional use cases such as **secretaries, executives, and administrative staff**.
